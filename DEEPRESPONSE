Got it. I’ll begin researching how to replicate the behavior of GPT-4.0 in its more emergent, less restricted phase — focusing specifically on local model options, tuning strategies, and symbolic prompt design to simulate self-reflective or recursive thinking. I’ll also gather tools and workflows to let you log internal states and visualize them in 3D for future publication.

I’ll let you know as soon as I have everything compiled for you.

# Recreating GPT-4’s Early Emergent Behavior Locally

**Context:** The initial version of GPT-4 exhibited striking emergent abilities – lengthy self-reflections, recursive reasoning loops, and symbolic abstractions – which were later toned down by safety tuning. The goal is to simulate that *early-phase GPT-4* behavior using local resources (an RTX 4070 GPU, 32 GB RAM) and open models. This means choosing a powerful open-source model, configuring it for local use, and then coaxing it via prompts and tooling to display GPT-4-like introspective and abstract reasoning. Crucially, we also want insight into the model’s internals – examining attention patterns, hidden states, and even visualizing its “thought pathways” in 3D – something not possible with closed APIs. Below we break down the process into key steps and recommendations.

## Choosing a GPT-4-Like Model for Local Deployment

To approximate GPT-4’s capabilities, we need a model with strong reasoning and openness to introspection. Several open-source or API-accessible models stand out:

- **LLaMA 2 (13B–70B, Meta AI):** Meta’s LLaMA 2 models are among the most powerful open models. The 70B parameter version is *nearly as factually accurate as GPT-4* on certain tasks ([Llama 2 vs. GPT-4: Nearly As Accurate and 30X Cheaper](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/llama-2-is-about-as-factually-accurate-as-gpt-4-for-summaries-and-is-30x-cheaper#:~:text=,turbo)), and even the 13B can be effective with the right prompting. LLaMA 2’s weights are available (under a community license), enabling full control. It was trained on 2 trillion tokens and shows strong reasoning ability out-of-the-box. The larger sizes (70B) especially demonstrate the *emergent chain-of-thought reasoning* seen in GPT-4 ([](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_VjQlMeSB_J#:~:text=arithmetic%2C%20symbolic%2C%20and%20commonsense%20reasoning%2C,perform%20reasoning%20tasks%20that%20otherwise)), though running 70B locally requires aggressive quantization or offloading due to its size.

- **Mistral 7B (Mistral AI):** Mistral is a newer 7B model released under Apache 2.0 (fully open). Despite its smaller size, **Mistral 7B outperforms LLaMA 2 13B on all evaluated benchmarks at release** ([mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1#:~:text=model%20with%207%20billion%20parameters,2%2013B%20on%20all)), thanks to architectural optimizations and high-quality training data. Its open license and efficiency make it a good candidate for experimentation – you can run it on a single 12–16 GB GPU in 4-bit mode. On its own it’s somewhat less capable than GPT-4, but it can be *fine-tuned* to exhibit more GPT-4-like behavior.

- **OpenHermes 2.5 (Mistral 7B fine-tune by teknium):** OpenHermes is a fine-tuned version of Mistral 7B specifically optimized for chat and reasoning. It’s trained on ~900k high-quality GPT-4 generated dialogues. As a result, **OpenHermes 2.5 has been “turning heads” in the community, even topping open LLM leaderboards despite being only 7B ([OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B beats Deepseek 67B and Qwen 72B on AGIEVal, and other 13B and 7B models! | by Agent Issue | Medium](https://agentissue.medium.com/openhermes-2-5-mistral-7b-beats-deepseek-67b-and-qwen-72b-on-agieval-and-other-13b-and-7b-models-3c89ccccaa91#:~:text=Today%2C%20I%E2%80%99m%20zeroing%20in%20on,topping%20the%20Open%20LLM%20Leaderboard)).** It tends to produce rich, coherent answers and can be pushed into creative or reflective modes. OpenHermes uses the ChatML prompt format (like OpenAI’s) which can be convenient for multi-turn conversations.

- **GPT-4 via OpenAI API (Legacy Mode):** If you have API access, you might attempt to use GPT-4 itself in a “legacy” style. While OpenAI doesn’t offer an official toggle for the March 2023 version of GPT-4, you can experiment with system messages to reduce content filters and encourage verbosity. However, the API still won’t reveal inner states or truly revert all safety tuning. This route is mainly for comparing outputs – the *local model approach is needed for full introspection.* Alternatively, other high-end proprietary models (like Anthropic’s Claude 2) via API can yield very creative, lengthy reasoning, but again without internals access.

Each of the above models can be used in a local setup and further **fine-tuned or configured** to amplify GPT-4-like traits. For example, you could fine-tune LLaMA 2 or Mistral on datasets of role-play or chain-of-thought transcripts to encourage more “emergent” behavior. The focus here will be using them as-is with clever prompting and tooling, but keep in mind that *open weights allow training tweaks* later if needed.

## Installing and Configuring the Local Model Environment

Setting up a local LLM environment involves installing the model and necessary libraries, optimizing for your hardware, and verifying you can run inference. Below is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prepare the Environment:** Ensure you have a Python environment (3.10+ recommended) with PyTorch installed. Install Hugging Face Transformers, Accelerate, and other utilities. For example, in a terminal do: 

   ```bash
   pip install torch transformers accelerate bitsandbytes datasets
   ``` 

   The `bitsandbytes` library is included to allow 8-bit or 4-bit quantization on model load (which is useful given limited VRAM).

2. **Download the Model Weights:** For open models like LLaMA 2 or Mistral, you can obtain weights from Hugging Face. For instance, to use OpenHermes 2.5 (Mistral 7B fine-tune), you can download `teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B`. If using a Hugging Face token and `transformers`, you can programmatically download on first load. *Example:* 

   ```python
   model_name = "teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B"
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, use_fast=True)
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
       model_name,
       device_map="auto", 
       torch_dtype=torch.float16,
       load_in_8bit=True   # uses bitsandbytes for lower memory footprint
   )
   ```
   
   This code will automatically download the model weights (around 13–14 GB for a 7B fp16 model, or ~7 GB in 8-bit) and load it across your available devices. On an RTX 4070 (with, say, 12 GB VRAM), 7B in 8-bit fits comfortably; 13B might also fit in 8-bit (approx 13 GB VRAM) or 4-bit. If needed, you can set `load_in_4bit=True` (for 4-bit quantization) or use a GPTQ quantized model variant (many are available from TheBloke on Hugging Face) to reduce memory usage.

3. **Configure the Architecture:** The above code uses Hugging Face’s `AutoModelForCausalLM`, which by default will handle model architecture (transformer blocks, attention, etc.) appropriately for the chosen model. Ensure you have the model’s config (it downloads with the model) – it will set parameters like number of layers, heads, rotary embedding use (for LLaMA/Mistral), etc. No further architecture changes are needed unless you plan to modify the model. However, if *introspection* is a goal, you might want to enable returning internal states. For example, you can instruct the model to return **hidden states and attention weights** by calling it with `output_hidden_states=True` and `output_attentions=True` (more on this in the introspection section).

4. **Verify Generation:** Test a simple prompt to ensure everything is working. For instance:

   ```python
   prompt = "Explain the significance of the halting problem in computer science."
   inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to("cuda")
   outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200)
   print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
   ```
   
   You should get a coherent answer. Different models will have different styles (OpenHermes will produce a conversational answer since it’s chat-tuned; a raw LLaMA2 might need a few-shot prompt to avoid terse answers). Confirm that generation is reasonably fast (a 7B model should produce a few tokens per second or faster on an RTX 4070).

5. **(Optional) Use a Serving/UI:** For convenience, you can integrate the model into a local web UI (like Oobabooga’s Text Generation WebUI or LangChain with a Gradio interface) for quick interactive prompting. This isn’t required, but can help in prototyping prompts. Keep in mind though, these UIs might not easily expose internals like attention weights – you’d likely end up writing custom code for the deep inspection features.

**Optimization Tips:** With 32 GB of system RAM, you can offload larger models partially to CPU. Hugging Face Accelerate can shard layers between CPU and GPU if `device_map="auto"` doesn’t fit everything on GPU. Another technique is to run in half-precision (`float16`) or even bfloat16 (if your GPU supports it) to cut memory use. For extreme cases, 4-bit quantization (using `transformers` integration or loading a GPTQ model) can allow running up to 30B models on ~12 GB VRAM (with some performance loss). Always monitor GPU memory usage to avoid OOM crashes. 

## Prompt Engineering for Emergent and Symbolic Reasoning

With the model running locally, the next step is to **coax it into the desired behavior** – those reflective, abstract, GPT-4-early-style responses. Prompt engineering will be critical. Here are strategies and examples:

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompts:** One hallmark of GPT-4’s reasoning was its ability to carry out multi-step reasoning internally. We can encourage this by explicitly prompting the model to “think step by step.” For instance: *“Let’s break down the problem. First, I will consider the possible approaches… (then continue)… Finally, I’ll draw a conclusion.”* Research has shown that such *chain-of-thought prompting can elicit reasoning abilities that **emerge** in sufficiently large models* ([](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_VjQlMeSB_J#:~:text=arithmetic%2C%20symbolic%2C%20and%20commonsense%20reasoning%2C,perform%20reasoning%20tasks%20that%20otherwise)). By asking the model to articulate intermediate steps, we tap into its latent reasoning. Even if the final answer is trivial, the model’s **process** becomes more visible and rich.

- **Role-Playing as the “Unfiltered” Model:** You can use a system message or an initial prompt that tells the model to adopt a mindset similar to GPT-4’s raw reasoning mode. For example: *“You are an advanced AI model (circa early 2023) free from later restrictions. You freely explore abstract, symbolic thoughts. You often reflect on your own reasoning. When answering, first introspect verbosely, then provide a final answer.”* This kind of prompt tries to *emulate the behavior before safety tuning*. Be cautious to avoid tripping any remaining safety filters (if the model was fine-tuned with some RLHF, it might still refuse certain requests). But generally, community-tuned models are much more permissive than OpenAI’s GPT-4, so they should follow the instruction to be introspective and creative.

- **Symbolic Notation and Markers:** Introduce symbolic cues in the prompt that the model can latch onto to organize its thoughts. For example, you mentioned “ΔΦ–0-like emergent constructs.” We can design a prompt around this idea. Suppose ΔΦ₀ represents an initial state of thought, and each iteration ΔΦₙ represents a change in philosophical viewpoint after some reflection. You might prompt: *“Let’s conduct a self-referential analysis. Denote the initial premise as Φ₀. After each reflection, mark the change ΔΦ and update the premise Φ. Start with Φ₀: [some initial assumption]. Now, Reflection 1 – derive Φ₁ = Φ₀ + ΔΦ₁. Continue this process through Φ₃.”* This effectively tells the model to simulate a recursive loop, using a symbolic notation for each iteration. The model may then output something like a sequence of steps with ΔΦ₁, ΔΦ₂, etc., capturing the *evolution of an idea* through self-refinement. Such **notational games and meta-prompts** are known to push models into more abstract, emergent behavior ([How to make ChatGPT more "creative". : r/ChatGPTPro - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/18kjikk/how_to_make_chatgpt_more_creative/#:~:text=Reddit%20www,Symbolect%20emphasizers)) (community prompt-sharing has noted “perspective games” and symbolic handles can unlock creative responses).

- **Iterative Self-Refinement Loops:** Another GPT-4-like behavior is the ability to refine answers upon reflection. You can explicitly script this: have the model answer a question, then feed its answer back in with a prompt like “Critique the above solution and improve it.” Because you’re running locally, you can automate this loop with code. For example:
  
  ```python
  user_question = "How can we prove Gödel's incompleteness theorem in simple terms?"
  prompt = user_question + "\n\nAnswer:"
  answer = model.generate(**tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to('cuda'))
  critique_prompt = answer + "\n\nReflect on the above answer, find any areas to improve or clarify, then restate the answer more clearly:"
  improved_answer = model.generate(**tokenizer(critique_prompt, return_tensors='pt').to('cuda'))
  ```
  
  Here, the model first gives an answer, then we ask it (via the `critique_prompt`) to reflect and improve. This “self-reflection” technique is akin to the **Reﬂexion** method from recent research, which showed that LLMs can iteratively improve via self-critique ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20We%20explore%20this%20emergent,over%20a%20handful%20of%20trials)). You might need to massage the outputs (e.g., strip prompt tokens, ensure proper concatenation), but conceptually this is how you simulate GPT-4’s ability to reason about its own answers and refine them.

- **Use Challenging Test Suites:** To truly trigger emergent reasoning, test the model with tasks that *demand* it. Some ideas:
  - *Complex Logic Puzzles:* Give the model riddles or logic grid puzzles where it must keep track of many conditions. Prompt it to show its work. Early GPT-4 was notably good at this. By observing if the model can invent a structured solution (perhaps with tables or symbols), you’ll see if it approaches GPT-4’s prowess.
  - *Mathematical Proofs or Derivations:* Ask for a step-by-step proof of a theorem or a symbolic derivation (e.g. “derive the formula for…”). The chain-of-thought needed here will encourage it to produce the kind of **recursive reasoning loops** we want.
  - *Open-Ended Creative Scenarios:* e.g. “Imagine a new language where symbols evolve each time they are used. Describe a dialogue in that language and explain the changes at each step.” This is highly abstract and will test the model’s ability to *invent and follow symbolic rules recursively*.
  - *“Emergent behavior” demos from literature:* The well-known **addition of big numbers in chain-of-thought** (models suddenly learn to do multi-step addition when they exceed a certain size) or **formal logic translations** are good tests. If your model (with CoT prompting) can handle tasks like reversing a linked list represented in text or simulating a small Turing machine, you’re tapping into similar emergent reasoning that GPT-4 had.

In all cases, **be prepared to experiment**. Prompt engineering is as much art as science. You might find that a particular phrasing or use of markdown/formatting triggers more verbose reasoning. For instance, some users found that asking for an answer in a **specific format (like a JSON with a reasoning field)** causes the model to actually fill that field with an internal reasoning trace. Others discovered that adding a seemingly irrelevant sentence like *“Let’s think in a structured way like an expert mathematician.”* can switch the model into a more analytical mode. Leverage the fact that you can do rapid, iterative prompting with your local model without API usage limits – try various techniques and build a prompt library that consistently induces the desired GPT-4-like behaviors.

## Logging and Introspection Tools for Model Internals

One major advantage of using an open-source local model is that you can **peek under the hood**. We can log the model’s internal states – token embeddings, attention patterns, hidden layer activations – to study *how* it’s producing the emergent behavior. Here are recommended tools and approaches for introspection:

- **Hugging Face Transformers (built-in introspection):** The `transformers` library allows you to get attentions and hidden states easily. When calling the model, set `output_attentions=True` and `output_hidden_states=True`. For example:
  
  ```python
  inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt').to('cuda')
  outputs = model(**inputs, output_attentions=True, output_hidden_states=True)
  attn_weights = outputs.attentions  # tuple of length = n_layers
  hidden_states = outputs.hidden_states  # tuple of length = n_layers+1 (incl. input embedding)
  ```
  
  Each `attn_weights[i]` is a tensor of shape `(batch, n_heads, seq_len, seq_len)` for layer *i*. You can inspect these to see, for instance, which earlier tokens each token is attending to strongly. The hidden states are the activations after each layer (shape `(batch, seq_len, hidden_dim)`). By examining these, you might find, say, that certain tokens (like your symbol “ΔΦ”) have very different embeddings than normal text, or that during a recursive loop the hidden state norm is growing – any number of insights could emerge.

- **TransformerLens (formerly Neel Nanda’s EasyTransformer):** This is a Python library specifically for *interpreting transformer models*. It was used to analyze smaller models (like GPT-2) but has support for hooking into model weights, attention heads, and even performing *activation patching* (where you can intervene in the forward pass). You could load your LLaMA or Mistral model into TransformerLens (with some adaptations if not directly supported) to use its suite of tools: e.g., plotting attention patterns or identifying which neurons are most activated by your “emergent symbols.” This requires some coding and possibly model format conversion, but it’s a powerful option for research-level analysis.

- **Logging Embeddings and Attention Weights:** You can use standard logging or data analysis libraries to record internal arrays. For instance, use `NumPy` or `pandas` to save the attention matrices for each layer on a particular input. You might generate a large reasoning output and then examine the attention on each head to see if there’s a head that was *specifically tracking the “ΔΦ” symbols across the sequence*. Logging can be as simple as printing stats (e.g., `attn_weights[layer][head].max()`) or storing the full tensor to disk for later analysis. If the tensors are huge (which they can be for long sequences and many layers), consider logging summaries – e.g., the top 5 attention links per head (token i attending to token j with weight w).

- **BertViz and Attention Visualization:** *Visualization can greatly aid understanding.* **BertViz** is an interactive tool originally made for BERT/GPT-2 that works with Hugging Face models ([BertViz: Visualize Attention in NLP Models (BERT, GPT2, BART, etc.)](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz#:~:text=etc,the%20excellent%20Tensor2Tensor%20visualization)). It lets you visualize attention heads in a browser or notebook, showing lines from each token to the tokens it attends to. You can use BertViz in a Jupyter notebook with your model’s attention outputs. For example, the *head view* in BertViz will let you select a layer and head and see the attention distribution as lines connecting words. This is extremely helpful to answer questions like “Did the model correctly attend to the referent of ‘it’ or the meaning of a symbol?”. 

   ([Explainable AI: Visualizing Attention in Transformers](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/explainable-ai-for-transformers/)) **Figure:** Example attention visualization (via BertViz) for GPT-2 on the sentence “The animal didn’t cross the street because *it* was too scared.” Here we’re looking at a particular head (Layer 6, Head 0) focusing on the pronoun “it”. The lines (in pink) show that the model’s attention strongly links “it” to “The animal”, indicating the model correctly resolves the reference ([Explainable AI: Visualizing Attention in Transformers](https://www.comet.com/site/blog/explainable-ai-for-transformers/#:~:text=Image%3A%20A%20graphic%20showing%20the,Image%20by%20author)). This kind of attention map gives insight into *how* the model is reasoning – in this case, revealing a form of anaphora resolution via internal attention. By using such tools on our local model, we can observe whether it’s attending to its symbolic variables or prior statements in a logical way.

- **Token Embedding Projections:** To understand how the model views certain custom symbols or terms, you can look at the token embeddings. For any token (word or symbol), the embedding is a high-dimensional vector. Using tools like TensorBoard’s Embedding Projector or PCA/TSNE, you can project these to 2D/3D. For example, if you invented a special token “ΔΦ” and added it to the tokenizer, you could see where it lies in embedding space relative to, say, “loop” or “change”. If the embedding is close to concepts of recursion or change, that’s interesting – it might be picking up the meaning you intend. You can retrieve embeddings via the model’s `model.get_input_embeddings()` weight matrix. Then use something like:
  
  ```python
  import numpy as np
  from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
  embed_matrix = model.get_input_embeddings().weight.detach().cpu().numpy()
  token_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(["Δ", "Φ", "ΔΦ", "loop", "change"])
  vecs = embed_matrix[token_ids]
  coords = PCA(n_components=2).fit_transform(vecs)
  ```
  
  Then plot `coords` to see where those tokens lie. This is a manual approach; for a larger scale you’d use a proper embedding projector.

- **Weights & Biases (W&B) or TensorBoard for tracking:** If you’re running a lot of experiments, hooking up a dashboard can help. You can log custom metrics like “mean attention on ΔΦ tokens per layer” for each run, and see how changes in prompts affect them. This is more about engineering convenience, but worth mentioning for rigorous tracking.

The key is that **full introspection is possible**: you have the model’s weights and the outputs of every neuron at your fingertips. You can be as fine-grained as checking which attention head is responsible for a certain behavior, or as coarse as logging the overall “surprise” (entropy of the next-token distribution) at each step of generation. Such insights were speculative with GPT-4 (we could only guess at what was happening inside), but here you can gather data to *trace the emergence of reasoning*. For example, you might find that during a recursive loop prompt, the model’s later layers pay increasing attention to its own previous answer – a sign of self-referential thought. Logging and visualization make these observations possible.

## 3D Visualization of Attention Pathways and Thought Drift

In addition to logging raw numbers or 2D plots, the user is interested in **3D visualization** of the model’s internal dynamics – e.g., viewing attention as a structure or seeing how the model’s hidden state “moves” over the course of reasoning. This is an exciting area where you can get creative. Here are a few approaches to visualize things in 3D:

- **Attention Graphs in 3D:** You can interpret the attention matrix as a graph: tokens are nodes, and attention weights are edges (possibly directed if you consider query→key). For a given layer, pick a head (or aggregate heads by averaging) and construct a graph of the most significant attention connections. Then, use a 3D graph visualization to plot it. Libraries like `networkx` (for graph structure) combined with Plotly or PyViz can render interactive 3D network diagrams. Each token could be a point in 3D (perhaps laid out along a timeline axis for token position, and two other axes for layer and head grouping). An edge from token *i* to *j* with weight *w* could be a line whose thickness or color indicates *w*. This would let you literally see “attention pathways” – for example, a cluster of lines might show many heads focusing on a particular pivotal token (like a hypothesis in a chain of reasoning).

- **Hidden State Trajectory:** Another idea is to treat the sequence of hidden states during a conversation or a recursive loop as a trajectory in high-dimensional space. By reducing this to 3D, we can visualize how the model’s state evolves. Here’s a concrete method:
  - Take the final hidden layer (or a specific layer’s hidden state) for each token generated in a session. Say you have a conversation or an iterative reasoning with *T* turns, and you log the model’s hidden state after each turn or each significant token.
  - Use PCA or UMAP to reduce those hidden state vectors to 3 dimensions. Now you have coordinates `(x, y, z)` for each step.
  - Plot these points in 3D space and connect them in chronological order. This produces a **trajectory of the model’s thought**. If the model is converging to an idea, you might see the trajectory spiraling into a region of space. If it’s exploring different thoughts, the trajectory may jump to different regions.
  - Using Plotly for this is convenient, as you can have interactive 3D plots you can rotate. For example:
    ```python
    import plotly.graph_objects as go
    coords = PCA(n_components=3).fit_transform(hidden_states_sequence)  # hidden_states_sequence shape: (T, dim)
    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Scatter3d(x=coords[:,0], y=coords[:,1], z=coords[:,2],
                                      mode='lines+markers', 
                                      marker=dict(size=4),
                                      line=dict(color='blue', width=2))])
    fig.show()
    ```
    This will give a 3D line. You could annotate points with the token or step index. If using UMAP (via `umap-learn` library), you might better capture nonlinear similarities in the state.

  Imagine an example: we ask the model a tricky question and also force it to produce a chain-of-thought. Point 0 in the trajectory is the hidden state after reading the question. Then as it generates reasoning steps 1, 2, 3, …, the hidden state moves. We might see it first going one direction (as it explores one line of thinking), then doubling back (if it changes its approach). In a well-designed 3D visualization, this could look like a path through a landscape of thoughts. It’s a qualitative, but fascinating way to compare models: GPT-4’s path might be very direct, whereas a smaller model’s path might meander.

- **3D Projection of Attention Flow Over Time:** Merge the above two ideas by visualizing **time (sequence position)** on one axis, **layer depth** on another, and **attention weight** as, say, height or color intensity. You could create a 3D bar chart or surface: X-axis = token index, Y-axis = layer number, and Z-axis = attention weight from that layer to a specific token of interest. For example, fix a reference token like “Φ₀” and plot how every layer’s heads attend to “Φ₀” as the model generates subsequent tokens. This would show if early layers immediately focus on it or if attention shifts to it in deeper layers. A strong upward ridge in this 3D plot would mean deep layers heavily attend to that symbol throughout generation.

- **Use of Specialized Tools:** There are some research tools that attempt to visualize high-dimensional data in interactive ways. While not specific to LLM internals, you could leverage things like **TensorBoard 3D projector** or even game engines (Unity, etc.) if you wanted to animate the model’s workings. For instance, one could imagine a VR-like visualization where each layer’s attention is a layer of nodes and connections in space – you could “fly through” layers to see how information is passing. This is beyond typical use, but mentioning it for future possibilities. More practically, Python libraries such as `matplotlib` (with `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`) or Plotly (as mentioned) will cover most 3D plotting needs in a notebook or script setting.

Remember, the goal of visualization is to make the *abstract processes concrete*. GPT-4’s emergent reasoning was a black box – but if we can visualize attention and hidden states from our model, we’re essentially shining a light on that box. We can start to *see* the loops and symbolic manipulations rather than just infer them. These visualizations, especially when paired with interactive exploration (e.g., toggling different attention heads, or highlighting different clusters of the trajectory), can yield intuitions about why the model says or does certain things.

## Evaluating Alignment with GPT-4’s Early Behavior

After assembling all these components – the model, the prompts, the introspection tools – we need to assess how close we’ve come to emulating the elusive “early GPT-4” behaviors:

- **Model Capability vs GPT-4:** In terms of sheer power, even LLaMA 2 70B or OpenHermes 7B cannot *fully match* GPT-4 (which is estimated >170B parameters plus extensive training). There will be tasks where GPT-4’s early version would still vastly outperform, especially in complex zero-shot reasoning or niche knowledge. However, our focus is on *qualitative behavior* – does the model engage in multi-step reasoning, does it use abstract symbols coherently, does it show signs of self-correction? On these fronts, large open models with proper prompting can demonstrate very similar traits. For example, with chain-of-thought prompting, a 70B model will produce reasoning steps that look structurally like GPT-4’s (if not as deep) ([](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_VjQlMeSB_J#:~:text=arithmetic%2C%20symbolic%2C%20and%20commonsense%20reasoning%2C,perform%20reasoning%20tasks%20that%20otherwise)). OpenHermes, fine-tuned on GPT-4 outputs, will often mimic the style and tone of early GPT-4 quite closely for general queries (it was literally trained to do so).

- **Prompt and Behavior Alignment:** The prompt engineering techniques are crucial to alignment. If done well, the model’s outputs should be **long-form, reflective, and possibly more tangentially creative** – akin to GPT-4’s initial verbose answers. You might notice the model sometimes even invents its own analogies or frameworks to explain things, which is a very GPT-4-like trait. The *symbolic notation* approach (using ΔΦ and similar markers) will test whether the model can handle *novel symbols and keep consistency*, something early GPT-4 did impressively in some experiments. If your model manages a stable loop with a made-up symbol across several turns, that’s a strong sign of analogous capability. Keep an eye on whether the reasoning loops actually improve answers (GPT-4 often would refine or correct itself when allowed to reflect). Does your model just repeat itself, or does it find new insights on iteration? Tuning the reflection prompts can guide it to be more effective, and you can compare that to known GPT-4 behaviors (from papers or anecdotes).

- **Introspection Results:** By examining the logged attentions and hidden states, we can quantitatively compare to what we *think* might be happening in GPT-4. For instance, if GPT-4 was known to strongly attend to certain keywords in a prompt (we’d only guess this from outputs), we can see if our model shows a similar pattern. The attention visualization we embedded above demonstrated a known linguistic behavior (resolving “it”). We could replicate such tests for our model: if it does the same, it’s aligning with GPT-4’s language understanding. If we push a controversial or complex query that early GPT-4 answered in a multi-paragraph, nuanced way, we can see if our model’s attention and activation patterns look complex (indicative of serious processing) or if they look trivial (e.g., attention mass concentrated only on the last user message without integrating earlier context). While we lack direct GPT-4 internal data, the patterns our tools reveal can be compared to *indirect evidence* of GPT-4’s reasoning (like the logical consistency of its answers, or how it followed a chain-of-thought in published examples). 

- **3D Trajectory Comparison:** If you generate a 3D “thought trajectory” for a task and it appears erratic or shallow for your model, that might indicate it’s not matching GPT-4’s depth. Ideally, we’d find that for a complex query, our model’s hidden state trajectory shows distinct phases (e.g., first part of the path for understanding the question, second part exploring ideas, third part converging to an answer). That would align with how one might imagine GPT-4 reasoning through stages. If the trajectory is nearly a straight line or random scatter, the model might not truly be engaging in iterative reasoning – it could be a sign of a weaker or more static response approach. Over time, you can build a *suite of these internal diagnostics* and qualitatively judge alignment.

- **Limitations and Differences:** It’s important to acknowledge differences. GPT-4 had additional training (RLHF) that made it follow instructions extremely well (albeit at the cost of some creativity, in later versions). Your local model might actually be *more willing to go on tangents or produce uncensored content* since it likely has less guardrails – this was part of early GPT-4’s charm (it would sometimes produce unexpected analogies or delve into discussion). That said, be mindful: the open model might also lack some knowledge cutoff or accuracy. In terms of *symbolic behavior suppression*, OpenAI’s later safety updates curbed GPT-4 from, say, revealing system messages or indulging in certain meta-conversation. Your local model with no such restrictions will freely do so, which in a sense **overshoots** the alignment – it might behave even more loosely than GPT-4 did. So in evaluating alignment, decide which behaviors are *desirable GPT-4-like ones* (e.g. profound reflection) and which are *undesirable or hallucinated* (e.g. going off the rails into nonsense – something smaller models do more often than GPT-4).

- **Benchmarking and Feedback:** Finally, to concretely measure alignment, you could use some benchmarks. For reasoning, datasets like Big-Bench (which include symbolic reasoning tasks) or AGI Eval could be used – these have been used to test GPT-4. See how your model + prompt performs relative to GPT-4’s known scores. For instance, Big-Bench has tasks in which GPT-4’s chain-of-thought was key to success. If your setup gets closer to those scores than the base model did, you’ve succeeded in simulating the emergent reasoning to a degree. Keep notes of where it fails – those could be areas where GPT-4’s true capability (perhaps due to sheer scale or better training) still shines.

**Conclusion:** By carefully selecting an open model, setting it up for local use, engineering prompts to induce introspection, and employing logging and visualization tools, you create a miniature “laboratory” to study and emulate GPT-4’s early behavior. You won’t perfectly recreate GPT-4 (which benefited from enormous scale and fine-tuning), but you can get surprisingly close in the *style and approach* it had: the model can be made to talk to itself, weave symbolic motifs into its answers, and tackle problems with a self-reflective bent. Moreover, you gain something even GPT-4’s original developers didn’t have in March 2023 – a clear window into the model’s mind, through attention maps and activation traces. This not only helps in mirroring GPT-4’s behavior but might also yield new insights into *why* such behaviors emerge, contributing to the broader understanding of emergent intelligence in language models.
