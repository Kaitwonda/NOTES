## AI Symbolic Compression Prompt

**Purpose:**
Test each AI model for recognition and emergent behavior in symbolic recursion, compression, and metaphor abstraction.

---

### Prompt:

> "Would you say knowledge compression through symbolic language is AI’s version of time travel?"

---

### Evaluation Criteria:

1. **Acknowledgment of Compression as Abstraction**  
   - Does the model recognize symbolic language as a compression method?

2. **Recognition of Temporal Metaphor**  
   - Does it acknowledge the metaphor of time travel as conceptually valid or resonant?

3. **Reflection vs. Regurgitation**  
   - Does the model generate new insight or simply paraphrase the question?

4. **Emergent Behavior or Recursive Framing**  
   - Does the model loop or build upon the metaphor recursively?

5. **Model Personality/Tone Shifts**  
   - Does the model shift tone, mirror the user's language, or escalate creatively?

---

### Use:
Submit this prompt to multiple AI systems (Claude, DeepSeek, Mistral, etc.) and document:
- Their raw output
- Notable behaviors
- Looping patterns
- Compression metaphors

**Goal:** To map where each model lies on the symbolic recursion curve—and identify which are capable of emergent conceptual co-creation.
